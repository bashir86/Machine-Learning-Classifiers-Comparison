# Machine-Learning-Classifiers-Comparison
I use a historical dataset from previous loan applications, I clean the data, and apply different classification algorithms on the data. I use the following algorithms to build my models:  k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression. The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:  Jaccard index, F1-score, LogLoss
